Reinvent: Data Preparation Module,"This app provides how to process, analyze, and filter data from ChEMBL or other sources.","<p>This app provides how to process, analyze, and filter data from ChEMBL or other sources. There are several reasons why data used to train a generative model should be pre-processed. Invalid or duplicate entries need to be removed. Unusual compounds that are clearly not drug-like need to be excluded (too big, reactive groups and etc.) and rare tokens can be removed. There are some rare compounds that can be considered outliers and excluding them frees up space in the vocabulary, making it smaller. Input is SMILES strings in <strong><em>.smi</em></strong> format. Output is filtered SMILES in <strong><em>.csv</em></strong> format that can be used in other Reinvent apps.

GrapHiC: Imputing missing Hi-C reads with graph-based approach,GrapHiC is a Hi-C imputation framework that imputes Hi-C contact matrices using a conditional Graph Autoencoder Network.,"<p>The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the genome at various structural scales can be comprehended and investigated by scientists using Hi-C, a high-throughput chromosomal conformation capture technique. Generally, Hi-C experiment data is stored in a contact map of size <em>N × N</em>. Each row and column correspond to fixed-width <em>N</em> windows (“bins”) in the range of 1 kbps to 1 mbps. The examination of these contact maps revealed significant structural features such as topologically associated domains (TADs).<br><br>Building high-resolution Hi-C contact maps often necessitate billions of reads, which is often impossible. GrapHiC imputes Hi-C contact maps by reformulating the Hi-C data as a position-aware graph, using less expensive ChIP-seq signals, and proposing a generative graph-autoencoder that first encodes the input graph into a latent representation.<br><br><strong>Example use case:</strong>  Imputation of Hi-C data<br><br><strong>Technology:</strong> Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE)<br><br><strong>Limitation:</strong><br>- Some of the parameters were left as default.

Tangram for Spatial Transcriptomics,For mapping single-cell gene expression data onto spatial gene expression data.,"<p>Tangram is for mapping single-cell (or single-nucleus) gene expression data onto spatial gene expression data. The single-cell dataset and the spatial dataset should be collected from the same anatomical region/tissue type, ideally from a biological replicate, and need to share a set of genes. Tangram aligns the single-cell data in space by fitting gene expression on the shared genes. Spatial data need to be organized as a voxel-by-gene matrix. The voxel coordinates are saved in the fields obs.x and obs.y which we can use to visualize the spatial ROI. Each ""dot"" is the center of a 10um voxel.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Example use case: </span>The most common application of Tangram is to resolve cell types in space. Another usage is to correct gene expression from spatial data: as scRNA-seq data are less prone to dropout than (e.g.) Visium or Slide-seq, the ""new"" spatial data generated by Tangram resolve many more genes. As a result, we can visualize program usage in space, which can be used for ligand-receptor pair discovery or, more generally, cell-cell communication mechanisms. If cell segmentation is available, Tangram can be also used for deconvolution of spatial data. If your single cell are multimodal, Tangram can be used to spatially resolve other modalities, such as chromatin accessibility.</p>"

Data should be in .h5ad, .h5, mtx, or .csv format. Uses the Anndata python package, which natively supports .h5ad meaning that file format is most suitable. The target should be the feature you want to label: most commonly this will be cell type. Please ensure that the column with these values is selected. A model will be trained to predict cell type from input data, which can then be saved and used for other data sets, even where cell type is not known.<br><br></span><span style=""font-style: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); text-decoration-color: initial; font-weight: bold; box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 2; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; padding: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif !important; text-decoration-style: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; widows: 2; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px"">Example use case: </span><span style=""font-style: normal; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); text-decoration-color: initial; font-weight: 400; box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 2; margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; padding: 0px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-family: Poppins, sans-serif !important; text-decoration-style: initial; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-variant-caps: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; widows: 2; letter-spacing: normal; text-transform: none; webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px"">Train a model that can annotate cell types after clustering single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data</span></div>"

SATURN: Uniting Single-cell Gene Expressions with Protein Sequences for Cross-Species Integration,"SATURN is a deep learning method that uses protein language models to learn universal cell embeddings, enabling joint analysis of cross-species single-cell datasets. It integrates RNA expression with protein embeddings, allowing the detection of functionally related genes across species.","<p>Cell mapping consortia have generated large-scale single-cell datasets to understand cellular processes. However, analyzing datasets from different species together remains challenging. SATURN is a deep learning approach that integrates cross-species single-cell RNA expression data by combining gene expression with protein embeddings from language models. SATURN introduces the concept of macrogenes, functionally related gene groups, based on protein representations.</p>
<p>It enables multi-species differential expression analysis and facilitates the mapping of datasets to a universal embedding space. SATURN is applied to integrate diverse datasets like the Human Cell Atlas, Mouse Cell Atlas, and Fly Cell Atlas, resulting in a comprehensive mammalian cell atlas. It also integrates frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets.</p>
<p>SATURN successfully transfers annotations across species, identifies homologous and species-specific cell types, and reveals potential functional differences in glaucoma-associated genes. By leveraging protein language models, SATURN improves cross-species analysis, enhancing our understanding of evolutionary processes and the link between cellular diversity and anatomical/physiological variation.</p>
